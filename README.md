## About The Project

The app consists of several elements:

- [ ] Header - simple logo and slogan. 

- [ ] Search bar - allowing you to search for specific ID out of elements fetched from API. Only integers are allowed. 

- [ ] Results displayer - fetched data is being displayed in grid/table.
  As required, the application asks for filtered content from the API page (so they are not filtered on the front-end side).
    - [ ] Modals are being showed after clicking on any row. Modals contain detailed info fetched before from API.

- [ ] Page displayer - allows you to switch pages with content (info about total number of pages is fetched from API).
    
 ## To-do
