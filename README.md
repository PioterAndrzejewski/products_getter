## About The Project

The app consists of several elements:

- [ ] Header - simple logo and slogan. 

- [ ] Search bar - allowing you to search for specific ID out of elements fetched from API. Only integers are allowed.

- [ ] Results displayer - fetched data is being displayed in grid/table.
  As required, the application asks for filtered content from the API page (so they are not filtered on the front-end side).

    - [ ] Modals are being showed after clicking on any row. Modals contain detailed info fetched before from API.

- [ ] Page displayer - allows you to switch pages with content (info about total number of pages is fetched from API).

- [ ] Search Parameters - since the filtering is performed on the API side, all search parameters are dynamically generated by the front-end application, stored in the state and reflected in the URL.

 ## To-do
The application was a pre-recruitment task and there are no plans of future development. 
    
## Sources
The task is a recruitment task for the Codibly company and was performed in accordance with the specification provided by Codibly. 

## Why no demo?
The CORS policy imposed in the API task does not accept requests from github pages.
I encourage you to fork the repository and test the application on your computer.
